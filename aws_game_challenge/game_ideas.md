# Game Ideas for Amazon Q CLI Challenge

## Brainstorming Session

Here are several game ideas that would be suitable for building with Amazon Q CLI and PyGame:

1. **Space Invaders Clone**
   - Classic arcade-style shooting game
   - Simple mechanics but engaging gameplay
   - Demonstrates basic sprite movement, collision detection, and scoring

2. **Maze Runner**
   - Procedurally generated mazes
   - Player navigates through the maze to find the exit
   - Can implement different difficulty levels

3. **Memory Match Game**
   - Card-flipping memory game
   - Simple mechanics but can be visually appealing
   - Good for demonstrating state management

4. **Snake Game**
   - Classic snake game where the player controls a growing snake
   - Simple to implement but addictive gameplay
   - Good demonstration of collision detection and game state management

5. **Platformer Game**
   - Simple 2D platformer with jumping mechanics
   - Can include collectibles and obstacles
   - Demonstrates physics implementation

6. **Pong Clone**
   - Two-player paddle game
   - Simple mechanics but can be enhanced with power-ups
   - Good for demonstrating basic physics

7. **Puzzle Bobble / Bubble Shooter**
   - Shooting colored bubbles to match and pop groups
   - Demonstrates color matching algorithms and physics
   - Visually appealing and engaging

## Selected Game: Space Invaders Clone

After consideration, I've decided to implement a **Space Invaders Clone** for the following reasons:

1. **Recognizable Concept**: Most people are familiar with the game, making it easy to understand
2. **Appropriate Scope**: Can be implemented within a reasonable timeframe
3. **Demonstrates Key Concepts**: Shows sprite management, collision detection, and game state management
4. **Extensible**: Can be enhanced with additional features if time permits
5. **Visually Engaging**: Even with simple graphics, the game can be visually appealing

## Game Features

The Space Invaders clone will include:

- Player-controlled spaceship at the bottom of the screen
- Rows of alien enemies that move horizontally and drop down
- Player shooting mechanics to destroy aliens
- Alien shooting mechanics to challenge the player
- Score tracking
- Lives system
- Game over and win conditions
- Simple sound effects

This game will effectively demonstrate how Amazon Q CLI can assist in game development by generating code for various game components and mechanics.
